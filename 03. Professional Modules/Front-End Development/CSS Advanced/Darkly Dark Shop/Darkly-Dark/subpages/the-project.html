    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The idea for this simple design store originate from one of my favorite
        place to buy computer components. If you are into those kinds of stuff
        and you are from Bulgaria you probably are familiar with it. It's called
        <a target="_blank" href="http://nikem-bg.net/magazin.php">Nikem Net</a> and it looks like
        this.

    <p> It is a great place for us pc entusiasts to buy cheaper hardware for our
        machines.</p>

    <h2>Prelude</h2>
    <p>Soo... back then with my friend when we used to buy stuff from there
        I used to tell him that this site looks like it was made for homework
        for some IT student, because it looks so amateur and simple
        (but it works).
    </p>

    <p>
        And here we go a year or two later and the wheel of karma has turned around
        and this is exactly what I am about to do. I wish it was something else
        more unique, but after three other successfully completed projects like
        this one there is not much left in my head.
    </p>

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>In the current stage of the development is nothing more than proof of concept, as it has some bugs and the
        future is unclear.</p>
