    <h2>Antec Launches New Prizm Addressable RGB Fans</h2>
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog/Antec-Prizm-Fans-4-740x347.jpg" alt="image">
    <p>Antec Inc., a leading provider of high-performance computer components and accessories for the gaming, PC
        upgrade and Do-It-Yourself market, presents their new ARGB case fans, the PRIZM ARGB series. Taking style,
        performance and silence to the next level, Prizm ARGB is available in 120/140 mm, and is surrounded by a ring
        of addressable RGB LEDs and high-performance fan blades including the addressable RGB LED controller.</p>
    <h3>Antec Jumps into the Addressable RGB Fray with Prizm Case Fans</h3>
    <p>Illuminating the PC inside and out, the fans are characterized by dual-sided RGB LED lighting ring with 18
        independently-controllable LEDs. The Prizm ARGB fans are using the addressable RGB standard and are certified
        compatible with Asus Aura, Gigabyte RGB Fusion, ASRock RGB and MSI RGB. The PWM fans optimize heat dissipation
        and hydraulic bearing which ensures ultra-quiet operation. Both models feature 4-pin PWM input and around 32
        dBA maximum noise output. The 120 mm model spins up to 2.000 RPM, pushing up to 45.03 CFM of air, while the 140
        mm model spins up to 1.700 RPM, with up to 65.03 CFM air flow. Both models are backed by a warranty period of
        two years.</p>

    <p>The Prizm ARGB fans offer a perfect harmony between excellent cooling performance and unique style as well as
        noise-reducing technology and easy installation experience.</p>
    <p>All in all, these seem priced decently but nothing really groundbreaking. That being said fans generally aren’t
        a groundbreaking product. The RPM numbers are pretty good, though I am interested to know what the sound
        profile for these would sound like</p>
