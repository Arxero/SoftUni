    <p>
        <small>Last updated: Jule 11, 2018</small>
    </p>

    <p>
        In this article, "Awesome Chat" refers to the Syntrwave company and its employees; "Application" refers to the individual embeddable Web-based
        chat boxes and associated components provided as a service by Awesome Chat. These Applications taken together constitute
        the Awesome Chat Network. Our direct customers including those with free Awesome Chat Applications are our "Customers", and the users
        of Awesome Chats operated by our Customers are "Users". These terms and conditions apply to all Customers of the Awesome Chat Application,
        whether paid or free, and except where noted otherwise, they extend to Users as well.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the Awesome Chat Application, or making it available for use as a Customer, is only permitted if you are in agreement with
        the following terms and conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Services offered by Awesome Chat are provided AS IS, without any warranty of any kind, including, without limitation, the
            implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Use of any of
            the services is entirely at your own risk.

        </li>
        <li>Awesome Chat is not liable for any loss or damage to the user or equipment or third parties or information belonging to the
            user or third parties, arising from use of the services provided by Awesome Chat or by direct or indirect consequence
            of their use.

        </li>
        <li>Awesome Chat is not responsible for the content submitted to and published on any Awesome Chat Application when that content is generated
            by yourself, Customers, or Users. Awesome Chat will not be obliged to edit or remove any content on any Application except
            at its sole discretion.

        </li>
        <li>Awesome Chat reserves the right to alter or amend these terms at any time without prior notice.

        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Indemnity</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliates, business partners, officers, directors, employees
            and agents harmless from any loss, liability, claim, demand, damage, or expense (including reasonable legal fees)
            asserted by any third party relating in any way to your use of the Application or breach of these Terms of Service.
            We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter subject to indemnification by
            you, which shall not excuse your indemnity obligations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Awesome Chat Applications: Content and Use</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Certain content is not permitted to be submitted to or published on the Awesome Chat Network, including but not limited to
            such that:
            <ol>
                <li>is unlawful, abusive, threatening, harmful, obscene, lewd, offensive, defamatory or otherwise objectionable;</li>
                <li>infringes or may infringe on the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, rights of publicity, or other
                    proprietary rights of others;</li>
                <li>contains or causes to be downloaded programs or material which may harm users or their computer or software
                    (including but not limited to viruses, trojan horses, and worms.)</li>
                <li>is submitted in bulk and unsolicited, whether for commercial purposes or otherwise (including but not limited
                    to messages which would be considered spam or flooding.)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Customers are responsible for monitoring the content transmitted by Users, and published on their Awesome Chat Application, and to
            take necessary action to remove such content and to protect other Users from it when it constitutes content not
            permitted on the Awesome Chat Network.
        </li>
        <li>
            Customers must extend our
            privacy policy to Users, in particular by honoring requests to remove personally-identifying information
            at the request of Users, and by refraining from publishing Users' IP addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
            Awesome Chat reserves the right to edit or delete part or all of the content of any Awesome Chat Application if it deems such action necessary.
            Awesome Chat may also deny access to the Awesome Chat Network to Users at its discretion. Awesome Chat is not, however, obliged to take
            action against Users or content under any circumstance, except where mandated by applicable law.
        </li>
        <li>
            Certain Awesome Chat Applications may include advertising elements and branding supplied by Awesome Chat. Customers may not obscure or obstruct
            or render invisible these elements.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <h2>Termination and Downgrade</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Awesome Chat retains the right to cease provision of service to any Customer for violation of these Terms or for any other reason,
            without prior notice.
        </li>
        <li>
            If we choose to cease service to a Customer with a paid service, for reasons other than violation of these Terms, the Customer
            is entitled to a pro-rata refund of unused credit. If service is terminated due to violation of these Terms,
            or the Customer does not have a paid service, no credit, refund or other compensation will be provided.
        </li>
        <li>
            Customers may cancel or downgrade paid services at any time by contacting us. However, we cannot downgrade paid accounts
            to free accounts. Customers with credit remaining can have this credit transferred to another account or converted
            on a pro-rata basis, but it cannot be refunded in part or in full.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
        If you choose to cease service, our 30-day money-back guarantee applies: your first purchase can be refunded in full on request,
        provided the transaction was completed within 30 days of the date of your request. Outside of this period or on subsequent
        upgrades or renewals, refunds are not available except at our discretion.
    </li>
</ol>
