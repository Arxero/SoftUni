        </li>
        <li>
            Customers must extend our privacy policy to Users, in particular by honoring requests to remove personally-identifying information

        </li>
        <li>
            Awesome Cars Media reserves the right to edit or delete part or all of the content of any Awesome Cars Media Application if it deems

    </ol>
    <h2>Termination and Downgrade</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Awesome Cars Media retains the right to cease provision of service to any Customer for violation of these Terms or for any other
            reason, without prior notice.
        </li>
        <li>
            If we choose to cease service to a Customer with a paid service, for reasons other than violation of these Terms, the Customer
            is entitled to a pro-rata refund of unused credit. If service is terminated due to violation of these Terms,
            or the Customer does not have a paid service, no credit, refund or other compensation will be provided.
        </li>
        <li>
            Customers may cancel or downgrade paid services at any time by contacting us. However, we cannot downgrade paid accounts
            to free accounts. Customers with credit remaining can have this credit transferred to another account or converted
            on a pro-rata basis, but it cannot be refunded in part or in full.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            If you choose to cease service, our 30-day money-back guarantee applies: your first purchase can be refunded in full on request,
            provided the transaction was completed within 30 days of the date of your request. Outside of this period or
            on subsequent upgrades or renewals, refunds are not available except at our discretion.
        </li>
    </ol>
