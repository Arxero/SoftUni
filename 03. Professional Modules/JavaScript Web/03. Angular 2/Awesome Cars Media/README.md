# Intro
Awesome Cars Media is a free web application for online communities and groups. Get it, and your visitors and users can see all your images and videos at one place.

# The Purpose
It is intended to be used in a standalone website and in a way to be extensions to your main [forum](http://awesomecs.syntrwave.com).
Â 
The reason for creating it is the fact that we do not have a small community
one main place where every funny screenshot, video or meme goes and if a newcommer
he wants to see more of us will not be easy for him.

# How to use it
1. Clone it to your GitHub Profile
2. Use [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to host your web application
3. Make an account in [kinvey](https://www.kinvey.com) and create your app with the correct collections (posts and comments).
4. Add the APP_KEY and APP_SECRET to the project itself and commit the changes to your clone of the app.
5. Add it to your forum or website.
6. Enjoy!
