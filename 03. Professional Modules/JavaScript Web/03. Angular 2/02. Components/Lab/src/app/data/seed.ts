    title: 'NASA put its famous planet-hunting telescope to sleep because it’s almost out of fuel',
    description: `The Kepler Space Telescope is almost out of fuel, which means its life is coming to an end, NASA announced today. The space agency says it put the planet-hunting spacecraft into a “hibernation” safe mode this past Monday, and that a plan to reactivate Kepler next month could burn out whatever fuel remains.

    NASA launched the Kepler Space Telescope in 2009 in an effort to learn more about the number and frequency of planets in our galaxy. To the delight of many, scientists using Kepler have found an abundance of exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system. The spacecraft, which is some 94 million miles away from Earth, has scanned just a small section of our galactic neighborhood, but its efforts have led scientists to discover 2,650 confirmed planets so far.
    
    They’ve come in all shapes and sizes, too. The planets that researchers have turned up range from big and weird — like a Jupiter-sized planet orbiting a binary star system — to ones that are closer in size and orbit to Earth. Each discovery has taught us more about how planets form, how many kinds of planets there are, and even how our planet came to be. And many rewards still lie in Kepler’s bounty. There are thousands more unconfirmed discoveries, and researchers continue to find new ways to rummage through Kepler’s data trove.`,

    title: 'Astronomers trace the source of a high-energy particle that slammed into Earth',
    description: `Astronomers may have discovered the deep-space origin of a mysterious high-energy particle that plunged straight through Earth last year. The tiny particle, known as a neutrino, seems to have come from a hyperactive black hole located 4 billion light-years away. It’s the first time researchers have pinpointed the possible origin for one of these high-energy neutrinos, bringing scientists closer to figuring out the objects that produce these strange lightweight particles that fill the Universe.

    In September, researchers working near the South Pole detected the presence of a super high-energy neutrino in the Antarctic ice. These fast-moving particles often zip right through objects like our planet without ever leaving a trace that they were there. But this visiting neutrino was a rare breed: it actually bumped into the ice, leaving a trail that the researchers were able to measure with their observatory, IceCube. The team then quickly mobilized to home in on the patch of sky that the particle came from.
    
    In that patch, they found a possible culprit for the neutrino: an overactive galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center. This kind of galaxy is actually known as a blazar, which means its black hole core is spewing radiation (and other stuff) in the direction of Earth. The discovery, detailed today in two papers in Science, serves as strong evidence that the neutrino originated from this black hole. That’s huge since astronomers have never been able to pinpoint the potential birthplace of a such a high-energy neutrino before. But now, blazars could be good places to look for neutrinos like this one in the future.`,

    title: 'Blue Origin pushed its rocket ‘to its limits’ with high-altitude emergency abort test',
    description: `Update July 18th, 11:35AM ET: Blue Origin pulled off another successful test launch today, landing both the New Shepard rocket and capsule after flight. The company ignited the capsule’s emergency motor after it had separated from the rocket, pushing the spacecraft up to a top altitude of around 74 miles — a new record for Blue Origin. The firing also caused the capsule to sustain up to 10 Gs during the test, but Blue Origin host Ariane Cornell said “that is well within what humans can take, especially for such a short spurt of time.”

    This morning, Jeff Bezos’ aerospace company Blue Origin will attempt the ninth test flight of its sub-orbital rocket, the New Shepard — a reusable vehicle designed to take tourists to the edge of space and back. And for this launch, the company will be testing out the vehicle’s escape motor once again. That’s the system that could help save the lives of future passengers if something were to go wrong during the climb through Earth’s atmosphere.`,

    title: 'Astronomers have found a new crop of moons around Jupiter, and one of them is a weirdo',
    description: `Ten more moons have been confirmed to orbit around Jupiter, bringing the planet’s total known satellite count to 79. That’s the highest number of moons of any planet in the Solar System. And these newly discovered space rocks are giving astronomers insight as to why the Jupiter system looks like it does today.

    Astronomers at Carnegie Institution for Science first found these moons in March 2017, along with two others that were already confirmed in June of last year. The team initially found all 12 moons using the Blanco 4-meter telescope in Chile, though finding these objects wasn’t their main goal. Instead, they were searching for incredibly distant small objects — or even planets — that might be lurking in our Solar System beyond Pluto. But as they searched for these fringe space rocks, they decided to take a peek at what might be lurking around Jupiter at the same time. Now, the moons they found have been observed multiple times, and their exact orbits have been submitted for approval from the International Astronomical Union, which officially recognizes celestial bodies.`,

    title: 'Virgin Orbit plans future rocket launches from the UK',
    description: `Small launcher company Virgin Orbit is taking some of its rocket launches to the UK. The company, a spinoff of space tourism venture Virgin Galactic, announced today that it is aiming to conduct missions of its new rocket, LauncherOne, from the Cornwall Airport Newquay on the southern tip of England by 2021. That will give Virgin Orbit at least two places to launch from — including its primary site in Mojave, California — as the company continues to search for other takeoff locations.

    If all goes according to plan, Virgin Orbit’s launches could be the first flights to go to space from British soil. Though the UK did announce this weekend that it intends to build an additional launch site in Scotland sometime in the early 2020s. However, Cornwall Airport is already an active commercial airport. This would be one of the few locations in the world that would serve as both an active airport and spaceport, accommodating airplane launches and rocket launches in tandem.`,
