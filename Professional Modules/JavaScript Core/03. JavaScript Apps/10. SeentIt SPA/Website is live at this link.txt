SeemIt SPA Exam from 20 August 2017

So I know this is not the homework we had, but I genuinely did not saw a point to do the homework
with handlebars and JS Patterns since I am not even that good with pure JQuery. And this time I think
it came out as a better version since I devided it into 3 files just like Nikola did in Book Library.

Sincerely,
